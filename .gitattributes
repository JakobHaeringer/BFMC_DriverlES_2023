# When working on Windows and Linux operating systems, the difference in line endings between
# the two operating systems can cause issues. For example, when Git reads from the object database,
# during e.g. a 'git checkout', it converts line endings stored in the object database to the
# operating system specific line endings (CLRF on Windows and LF on Linux) by default.
#
# So when you pull this repository on Windows, all line endings will be converted to CLRF. If you
# then go ahead and use the local repository inside a Docker container, those CLRF line endings will
# still be present and, e.g. in the case of shebangs, lines like
#
#     #!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# will actually be read by Linux upon execution as
#
#     #!/usr/bin/env bash\r
#
# which causes Linux to search for an executable called 'bash\r'. Such an executable obviously
# doesn't exist and causes Linux to fail to execute the given script.
